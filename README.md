# Fake Planetarium for Processing 2.x


## Outline

The program shows a full-screen fake planetarium using Processing 2.x software. The placement of the stars changes each time. You may find a lot of new and unique constellations in the sky.  
The number of stars, the degree of twinkling, and the moving speed can be specified by changing parameters on lines 20-23.
